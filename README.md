# portfolio-project
Portfolio project for Altcademy front-end design course.

Fonts used for this project include PT Serif and Overpass, both of which were acquired and supplied from Google Fonts.

Guides/tutorials that were referred to during the creation of this site include:

CSS Tricks - [Tinted Images with Multiple Backgrounds](https://css-tricks.com/tinted-images-multiple-backgrounds/)

Sitepoint - [How to Use Webfont Icons as Bullet Points in HTML5 Lists](https://www.sitepoint.com/use-webfont-icons-bullet-points-html5-lists/)

Future plans:
- Making the contact form functional.
- Adding a more dynamic look to the site; slanted borders for the bottom of the header and top of the footer
- Smooth scrolling when clicking links in the navigation
